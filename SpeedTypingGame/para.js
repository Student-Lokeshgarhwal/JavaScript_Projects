    "Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet user needs.The terms programmer and coder overlap software engineer, but they imply only the construction aspect of a typical software engineer workload.",
    "Software testing is the act of checking whether software satisfies expectations.Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and the risk of its failure to a user or sponsor. Software testing can determine the correctness of software for specific scenarios but cannot determine correctness for all scenarios. It cannot find all bugs.Based on the criteria for measuring correctness from an oracle, software testing employs principles and mechanisms that might recognize a problem.",
    "The software release life cycle is the process of developing, testing, and distributing a software product. It typically consists of several stages, such as pre-alpha, alpha, beta, and release candidate, before the final version, is released to the public. Pre-alpha refers to the early stages of development, when the software is still being designed and built. Alpha testing is the first phase of formal testing, during which the software is tested internally using white-box techniques.",
